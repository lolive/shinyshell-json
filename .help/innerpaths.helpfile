Retrieves JSON paths from standard input (usually the result of command jsonpaths), strips the leading path item.

For example, for paths:
a.b.m
a.c.m
b.b.y
b.c.m
b.d.z

this command returns:
b.m
b.y
c.m
c.m
d.z

Note: this command does not sort|uniq the list. Pipe it into command 'uniqpaths' if you need that feature.
